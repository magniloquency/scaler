    process has exited) propagate for the caller to handle.

    and raises a permission error under System Integrity Protection / the hardened runtime even for the
    caller's own process. ``memory_info().rss`` reads through ``proc_pidinfo`` and needs no such privilege,
    so we fall back to RSS on a permission denial rather than let the heartbeat routine crash.
